## VR-Project: Office Space Virtual Tour
The agenda of this project is to create a virtual environment of an office space. In this case we have recreated the office space inspired by the show 'Suits'. We have also created a simple user interface that lets the user control the view.
This virtual environment is created using Unity and Blender.
